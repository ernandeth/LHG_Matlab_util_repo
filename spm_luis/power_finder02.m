%
% The null hypothesis is that each images has a value equal
% to the mean value of all the images in the group.
% The alternative hypothesis is that they are not (double sided test)
% a p-value less than alpha means that they are different.
%
% This function computes the probability of being right if we reject the
% null hypothesis of being equal, based on a given effect size.
%
% Arguments and defaults:
%   x_var:  variance of the data (this coule be variance of paramater estimates). cols = pixels
%   alpha: 	significance level (0.05)
%   bf :   	Bonferroni correction factor.
%   x_effect:   Effect size to be assumed when calculating the Spower -
%               image of parameter estimate
%   Spower_threshold:       Desired Spower level
